      "techDescription": "For the development of Storage, I used modern tools aligned with industry best practices. On the frontend, I chose React for its flexibility and responsiveness, paired with Tailwind CSS for fast, consistent, and responsive styling. The UI was prototyped in Figma, providing a clear and collaborative design process before implementation. On the backend, I used Node.js with TypeScript for scalability and type safety, and Prisma as the ORM to simplify database communication. I chose PostgreSQL for its reliability and performance, and the entire application was containerized with Docker to streamline environment setup and future deployment."
